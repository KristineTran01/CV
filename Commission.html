		<h4>General</h4>
	
		<!--General TOS-->
	
		<ul>
		
		<li>I am comfortable with most themes, but <b>certain sensitive themes</b> such as 
		illegal themes, abuse, drugs and others that personally make me uncomfortable 
		<b>will be refused.</b></li>
		
		<li><b>I keep all the rights to my art.</b> I maintain the right to post in on my 
		portfolio and social media pages. If for any reason you would prefer your 
		commission remain private, please let me know in advance</li>
		
		<li><b>If you are uncomfortable with me potentially streaming or recording</b> the 
		process of creating your commission, <b>please let me know in advance</b></li>
		
		<li>I maintain <b>the right to refuse any commission</b> without further explanation</li>
		
		<li>I fully understand how hectic life can be and I am completely okay with commissioners 
		taking a while to get back to me during our communication, but ghosting for months 
		will result in blacklisting.</li>
		
		<li>In the rare case of a commissioner <b>failing to pay</b>, I will repurpose the commissioned artwork 
		for profit to make up for it.</li>
		
		<li>For commissions<b> depicting existing, real people,</b> I am much stricter on what I am comfortable 
		to draw, and will err on the side of caution.</li>
		
		<li>You will<b> recieve your final, full-size files as .pngs</b>, through email or google drive link 
		(deviantart customers can also get it through deviantart sta.sh). Feel free to ask for 
		different file types though.</li>
		
		<li><i>The more clear a customer is in what they are looking for, the smoother and faster the 
		commission will go, and the better the chances the result will be closer to what 
		you're looking for. I do not mind vagueness at all, especially with custom designs, 
		but I need to put this as a note, because I sincerely want you to be happy with the 
		end result.</i></li>
	
		</ul>
		
		<!--End of General TOS-->
		
		<h4>Payment</h4>		
		
		<!--Payment TOS-->
		
		<ul>
		
		<li>I accept payment only through paypal invoice, and in case the customer prefers it 
		for any reason, through Ko-fi.</li>
		
		<li>My prices are in USD, but I do also accept the euro equivalent</li>
		
		<li>For anything over $70 I ask for half the payment upfront. For less than that, I ask 
		for the payment at the completion of the commission and before sending the final 
		full-size files.</li>
		
		<li>Once the commission has progressed past the rough sketch stage, I do not do refunds.</li>
		
		</ul>
		
		<!--End of Payment TOS-->
		
		<h4>Communication</h4>
		
		<!--Comm TOS-->
		
		<ul>
		<li>Communication throughout the process of the commission can be done via email, 
		discord, twitter and instagram DMs as well as deviantart notes. Be aware that 
		instagram DMs are unreliable in their notifications so they are the least recommended 
		of the list, but still a valid option for those that prefer them.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<!--End of Comm Tos-->
		
		<h4>Timing & Process</h4>
		
		<!--Timing & Process TOS-->
		
		<ul>
		<li>Most simple commissions take anywhere from 2 weeks to a month and a half to complete.</li>
		
		<li>I try to give updates at least once a week on the progress of all commissions to each 
		customer individually. Only in the case of rare emergencies will this be affected.</li>
	
		<li>If for any reason you wish for your commission to be done in a specific time frame, 
		this needs to be discussed beforehand and there might be a rush fee.</li>

		<li>I check in with customers as much as I can throughout the process to ensure that everyone 
		is happy with the end result. I usually send updates and the commissioner can ask for 
		corrections and changes in the: rough sketch, clean lines and color phases.</li>

		<li>For the rough sketch phase, a reasonable amount of sketches from scratch can be offered.</li>
		
		<li>In regards specifically to custom designs, it's my top priority that the design fits the 
		commissioner's needs, so I can happily offer a larger amount or test rough sketches 
		and variations even further down the line if needed.</li>
		
		</ul>
		
		<!--End of Timing &Process TOS-->
		
		<h4>Use of My Art</h4>
		
		<!--Fair Use TOS-->
		
		<ul>
		
		<li>The art I create is for <b>personal use</b> of the individual commissioner only. For professional 
		use (including use in streams, monetized videos, merch shops etc) or businesses the prices and 
		process will differ and can be discussed seperately from anything mentioned on this website via 
		the means you can find on the "contact" page</li>
		
		<li>I do not allow my art to be used in NFTs or anything that has to do with NFTs , 
		crypto etc.</li>
		
		</ul>
